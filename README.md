In this Power BI case study, I explored a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data of employee attrition and to gain insights into factors that contribute to employee turn over.
#### Primary goal:
* Monitor key HR Metrics on employees
#### Secondary goal: 
* Understand what factors impact attrition
